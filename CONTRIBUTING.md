- [#54, Add Do Not Track handling](https://gitlab.com/elixire/elixire/issues/54)

Examples of Feature Proposals:

- [#125, domain tags for nsfw content](https://gitlab.com/elixire/elixire/issues/125)

Suggestions that eventually became Proposals:

- [#116, Handle lack of Discord webhook URLs gracefully](https://gitlab.com/elixire/elixire/issues/116)
  became [#107, rewrite side-effect (webhook, email) internals](https://gitlab.com/elixire/elixire/issues/107)
